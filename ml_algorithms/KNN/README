Ppredicting tumor diagnosis from new patient measurements

Goal:
Given measurements of a breast mass (radius, texture, perimeter, etc.), predict whether the tumor is:
M – malignant (cancer)
B – benign (not cancer)

This is a binary classification problem using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic dataset.

In a medical setting, they would clarify:
-Primary objective: Catch malignant tumors.
-Metric priority: High recall/sensitivity for malignants, while keeping precision acceptable (minimize false alarms but never miss too many real cancers)

KNN is a non-parametric, instance-based machine learning algorithm used for:
-Classification
-Regression
-Imputation (filling missing values)
-Recommendation
KNN does not learn a model.

Instead, it memorizes the training data and answers queries by looking at the closest neighbors.

How KNN Works 
Given a new data point:
-Compute the distance (Euclidean, Manhattan, etc.) to all training points
-Pick the K closest points
-For classification:
    *Majority vote among neighbors
-For regression:
    *Average the neighbor values
